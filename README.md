# Docker container for running Evilginx2

*Evilginx is an attack framework for setting up phishing pages. Instead of serving templates of sign-in pages lookalikes, Evilginx becomes a relay between the real website and the phished user. Phished user interacts with the real website, while Evilginx captures all the data being transmitted between the two parties.*

*Evilginx, being the man-in-the-middle, captures not only usernames and passwords, but also captures authentication tokens sent as cookies. Captured authentication tokens allow the attacker to bypass any form of 2FA enabled on user's account*

#### Phislets:

*Phishlets are new site configs. They are plain-text ruleset files, in YAML format, which are fed into the Evilginx engine*
